# Excel-based ML User Guide
A simple Excel-based user guide to help facilitate the discussions between data scientists and business units
Expected users are (1) business units who are requesting support in analytics areas, think they want some ML solution but are not sure which ones are most appropriate and (2) data scientists and programmers who are expected to provide ML solutions to business units but are not sure which solutions to suggest based on the business unit's needs
This is a simple first draft of a guidance tool so any feedback is greatly aprpeciated and all are welcome to use it if you find it valuable.  It was originally created for health care applications so there is a greater focus on p-values than would be found in many other industries
The list of suggested ML solutions is not comprehensive and will be expanded over time.
The target audience for this was specifically people in the health-care industry so there is some references made to p-values and more classical statistical analysis approached
